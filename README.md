# Search engine for movies & TV series that I designed and made myself
To make the application work correctly, install 'node_modules' via `npm install` first.<br>
Then, run the react app `npm start`.<br>
The application fetches data about movies and series from the API `https://www.themoviedb.org`.<br>
It has a drop-down category menu that is responsible for the sorting movies/series by category, if you click on a specific category it will display the best-rated movies/series in that category, search engine locks itself and every letter entered in the search field will display only movies/series in that category.<br>
Obviously, app has searching engine for a movie or series by name, if a category is not selected, it will display the most relevant movies/series for what you entered in the search box. <br>
The home page displays the best-rated movies/series.<br>
Additionally, it has the function of clicking on a specific movie/series to display more data about it.<br>
The app includes some animations.
